# poke-guess
<i>Disclaimer: I do not own Pokemon nor make any money off of it.</i>

Full-Stack Javascript web app that lets users guess the Pokemon's name through a random displayed image. Player has 10 seconds to type in his/her guess and clicking the Submit button. Being unable to guess correctly within the said time period 3 times will result to a lose. Guessing correctly 5 times will result to a win.<br><br>
Random Pokemon data is pulled from www.pokeapi.com through my API (app.js). API requires the Body-parser npm package, Request package, NodeJS, and ExpressJS to run. Please note that some later generation Pokemon have unupdated images (will improve on that soon!).<br><br>
Front-end uses HTML/CSS, Bootstrap, jQuery, and plain JavaScript.
