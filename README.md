# poke-guess
<i>Disclaimer: I do not own Pokemon nor make any money off of it.</i>

<p>Full-Stack Javascript web app that lets users guess the Pokemon's name through a random displayed image. Player has 10 seconds to type in his/her guess and clicking the Submit button. Being unable to guess correctly within the said time period 3 times will result to a lose. Guessing correctly 5 times will result to a win.</p><br>
<p>Random Pokemon data is pulled from www.pokeapi.com through my API (app.js). API requires the Body-parser npm package, Request package, NodeJS, and ExpressJS to run and listens in on Port 8888. Please note that some later generation Pokemon have unupdated images (will improve on that soon!).</p><br>
<p>Run landing.html to start the game and click Start to begin.</p>
Front-end uses HTML/CSS, Bootstrap, jQuery, and plain JavaScript.</p>
